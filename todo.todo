figure out how to center shadow to ball

contain ball to not go further than shadow on table our out of screen

   -probably using contain option in draggable()

make shadow bigger/smaller with y coordinate information

find good wall background (starry or witchy)

make it look better on phone

fix dragging on phone (or maybe figure out how to make shaking work instead)
    

-make dice fade in and out when shook and use the dice function @done
